JavaScript Isometric Grid View Generator

Author: Donald Jones

This is a simple app that will generate a blocky isometric view at random. It has a height map that will make really tall blocks have snow on top, really low blocks water, and average blocks either grass or dirt.

There are a few other JavaScript files in this project.

map.js -- map file required.
th.js -- view generation script (current)

dc.js (first experiment, generates a static map)
th2.js (experiment) changes the isometric projection slightly.
th-sizeable.js (broken experiment)
simple.js (unknown/forgotten)

The simple_tile.html file simply references the JavaScript files and creates a render canvas.
